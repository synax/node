# OneKube
Hassle free peer-to-peer based global scale Kubernetes. OneKube is about scrutinizing and removing everything limiting, extending the missing parts for a minimalistic global scale swarm for long lasting processes and functions. 

Minimalistic single binary with no distinction in role. OneKube is a true peer to peer architecture as demonstrated by bittorrent. Since there is no perimeter with low level networking integration, ukube follows natively the zero trust networking principles.
