# ukube
Hassle free peer-to-peer based global scale Kubernetes. Ukube is about scrutinizing and removing everything limiting, adding  new parts for a minimalistic global scale swarm for long lasting processes and functions as well. 

Minimalistic single binary with no distinction in role. ukube is a true peer to peer architecture as demonstrated by bittorrent. Since there is no perimeter with low level networking integration, ukube follows natively the zero trust networking principles.
